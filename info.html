                <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
                <p>This software is designed to offer various utilities to help in analyzing data and extracting
                    valuable
                    conclusions.</p>
                <h3>
                    Why?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Human minds are not optimized to consider extremely large datasets and draw conclusions and
                    consequently form predictions. We consistently require technical tools such as Microsoft Excel or
                    graphs to better understand the data. Nonetheless, humans simply cannot accurately analyze data to
                    the to extent that computational devices can. This is one area where AI will certainly prevail.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How does it work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I will only delve into the conceptual aspects of its function, but feel free to preview the code and
                    read the applicable <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs">TensorFlow API documentation</a>
                    for more practical information.<br><br>

                    This software, backed by the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep
                        Learning</a> utilizes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"
                        target="_blank">Artificial Neural Network</a> to
                    evaluate the patterns and characteristics of a provided dataset to train a Deep Learning Model.

                <p>
                    An Artificial Neural Network (ANN), often referred to as a Deep Neural Network (DNN), or a Neural
                    Network (NN), is comprised of a series of layers that an input must commute through to produce an
                    output. Each of these layers consists of a number of Artificial Neurons which hold weights and fire
                    accordingly (more later). You might notice that several of these terms are commonly used in the
                    fields of cognitive sciences, such as neuroscience and psychology. We too are provided input through
                    a sense, which is processed through layers of our neurological system, and actions and memories are
                    induced through the firing of particular neurons.That is no coincidence, the common objective of an
                    Artificial Neural Network is to emulate and improve on the function of the human brain. Completing
                    tasks the human brain can, and tasks that it cannot. The idea of the Turing Test, conceived by Alan
                    Turing, is to evaluate whether a machine can properly imitate a human in every intellectual way. At
                    such a point, the conscience of AI will be indistinguishable from humans.

                    ANN Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>In an ANN, the process is as follows:</b>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An input is provided to the first layer; the input layer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If applicable, the input reaches the hidden layers in the form of a series of weight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The input reaches the output layer, where a single weight may be assigned to the output, or a
                        probability distribution will be created of all possibles output. The number of neurons in this
                        layer will represent the number of possible outputs.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>
                    Types of Algorithms 
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Classification</h5>
                        <p>This algorithm is used when there is a finite amount of possible outputs for the result to be produced as. An example of this would be a neural network which may be used to classify a pet as either a cat or a dog. There are only two possible outputs and therefore it is logical to use a classification algorithm.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Regression</h5>
