                <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
                <p>This software is designed to offer various utilities to assist in analyzing data and extracting
                    valuable
                    conclusions.</p>
                
                <h4><b>Key practical knowledge</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Loss:</b> indicates how poorly a machine learning model performed in a prediction. The lower the better.</li>
                    <li><b>Accuracy:</b> indicates how well a machine learning model performed in a prediction. It is given as a percent. The higher the better.</li>
                    <li>This program only supports up to 25 classes in a classification dataset.</li>
                    <li>It is recommended that you manually set the algorithm. Classification shall be used when the responsive column has distinct values. Regression shall be used when the responsive column consists of a range of numbers ex: (0 - 10) or an effectively infinite amount of values.</li>
                    <li>There is no consistent optimal amount of epochs, it comes down to trial and error. Generally around 10 epochs offers decent results.</li>
                    <li>The models you train will be saved in the "models" folder of the program directory. Do not modify any files associated with a model.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Why?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Human minds are not optimized to consider extremely large datasets and draw conclusions and
                    consequently form predictions. We consistently require technical tools such as Microsoft Excel or
                    graphs to better understand data. Humans simply cannot accurately analyze data to
                    the to extent that computational devices can, therefore, the usage of computers is extremely beneficial in this area.

                    Understanding
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I will only delve into the conceptual aspects of its function, but feel free to preview the code and
                    read the applicable TensorFlow API documentation
                    for more practical information.<br><br>

                    This software, backed by the concept of Deep Learning utilizes an Artificial Neural Network to
                    evaluate the patterns and characteristics of a provided dataset to train a Deep Learning Model.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Artificial Neural Network (ANN), often referred to as a Deep Neural Network (DNN), or a Neural
                    Network (NN), is comprised of a series of layers that an input must commute through to produce an
                    output. Each of these layers consists of a number of Artificial Neurons which hold weights and fire
                    accordingly. You might notice that several of these terms are commonly used in the
                    fields of cognitive sciences, such as neuroscience and psychology. We too are provided input through
                    a sense, which is processed through layers of our neurological system, and actions and memories are
                    induced through the firing of particular neurons.That is no coincidence, the common objective of an
                    Artificial Neural Network is to emulate and improve on the function of the human brain. Completing
                    tasks the human brain can, and tasks that it cannot. The idea of the Turing Test, conceived by Alan
                    Turing, is to evaluate whether a machine can properly imitate a human in every intellectual way. At
                    such a point, the conscience of AI will be indistinguishable from humans.

                    ANN Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>In an ANN, the process is as follows:</b>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An input is provided to the first layer; the input layer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If applicable, the input reaches the hidden layers in the form of a series of weight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The input reaches the output layer, where a single weight may be assigned to the output, or a
                        probability distribution will be created of all possibles output. The number of neurons in this
                        layer will represent the number of possible outputs.
                    </li>
                </ol>
